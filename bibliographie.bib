title={Hybrid genetic deflated Newton method for global optimisation},
volume={325},
ISSN={0377-0427}, 
DOI={10.1016/j.cam.2017.04.047}, 
abstractNote={Optimisation is a basic principle of nature and has a vast variety of applications in research and industry. There is a plurality of different optimisation procedures which exhibit different strengths and weaknesses in computational efficiency and probability of finding the global optimum. Most methods offer a trade-off between these two aspects. This paper proposes a hybrid genetic deflated Newton (HGDN) method to find local and global optima more efficiently than competing methods. The proposed method is a hybrid algorithm which uses a genetic algorithm to explore the parameter domain for regions containing local minima, and a deflated Newton algorithm to efficiently find their exact locations. In each iteration, identified minima are removed using deflation, so that they cannot be found again. The genetic algorithm is adapted as follows: every individual of every generation of offspring searches its adjacent space for optima using Newton’s method; when found, the optimum is removed by deflation, and the individual returns to its starting position. This procedure is repeated until no more optima can be found. The deflation step ensures that the same optimum is not found twice. In the subsequent genetic step, a new generation of offspring is created, using procreation of the fittest. We demonstrate that the proposed method converges to the global optimum, even for small populations. Furthermore, the numerical results show that the HGDN method can improve the number of necessary function and derivative evaluations by orders of magnitude.},

ISBN={9780387747583}, 
abstractNote={The goal of the Encyclopedia of Optimization is to introduce the reader to a complete set of topics that show the spectrum of research, the richness of ideas, and the breadth of applications that has come from this field. The second edition builds on the success of the former edition with more than 150 completely new entries, designed to ensure that the reference addresses recent areas where optimization theories and techniques have advanced. Particularly heavy attention resulted in health science and transportation, with entries such as “Algorithms for Genomics”, “Optimization and Radiotherapy Treatment Design”, and “Crew Scheduling”.},

title={A Review of automatic differentiation and its efficient implementation}, 
volume={9}, 
ISSN={1942-4787, 1942-4795}, 
url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05031}, 
DOI={10.1002/WIDM.1305}, 
abstractNote={Derivatives play a critical role in computational statistics, examples being Bayesian inference using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling and the training of neural networks. Automatic differentiation is a powerful tool to automate the calculation of derivatives and is preferable to more traditional methods, especially when differentiating complex algorithms and mathematical functions. The implementation of automatic differentiation however requires some care to insure efficiency. Modern differentiation packages deploy a broad range of computational techniques to improve applicability, run time, and memory management. Among these techniques are operation overloading, region based memory, and expression templates. There also exist several mathematical techniques which can yield high performance gains when applied to complex algorithms. For example, semi-analytical derivatives can reduce by orders of magnitude the runtime required to numerically solve and differentiate an algebraic equation. Open problems include the extension of current packages to provide more specialized routines, and efficient methods to perform higher-order differentiation.},
